# Hybrid Headless React Plugin for WordPress

## Overview

The Hybrid Headless React Plugin is a sophisticated WordPress plugin that enables a hybrid headless architecture, combining the power of WordPress/WooCommerce with modern frontend frameworks like Next.js. This plugin serves as the crucial bridge between your WordPress backend and headless frontend, offering a unique approach where some routes are served headlessly while maintaining traditional WordPress functionality for authenticated flows.

- Seamless integration with WooCommerce checkout and cart processes

### 2. Advanced API Integration
- Custom REST API endpoints optimized for headless frontends
- Complete WooCommerce product data exposure
- Real-time stock level management
- Secure authentication handling
- CORS support with configurable origins

### 3. Performance Optimization
- Static file serving for Next.js assets
- Intelligent caching headers
- Optimized API responses
- Minimal database queries
- Support for CDN integration

### 4. Developer-Friendly

```

### Manual Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/hybrid-headless-react-plugin.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   composer install
   ```
3. Build the plugin:
   ```bash
   composer run build
   ```

## Configuration

### Basic Setup
1. Navigate to Settings → Hybrid Headless in WordPress admin
2. Configure the following essential settings:
   - Frontend URL
   - Build Path
   - Homepage Handling
   - Route Patterns

### Advanced Configuration
Create a `hybrid-headless-config.php` file in your wp-content directory:

```php
define('HYBRID_HEADLESS_FRONTEND_URL', 'https://your-frontend.com');
define('HYBRID_HEADLESS_DEBUG', true);
define('HYBRID_HEADLESS_CACHE_TTL', 3600);
```

## Usage

### Route Handling
The plugin automatically handles routing based on the configured patterns:

```php
// Add custom frontend route
add_filter('hybrid_headless_frontend_routes', function($routes) {
    $routes['custom'] = '/custom-path/{slug}';
    return $routes;
});
```

### API Extensions
Add custom API endpoints:

```php
add_action('rest_api_init', function() {
    register_rest_route('hybrid-headless/v1', '/custom', [
        'methods' => 'GET',
        'callback' => 'your_custom_callback',
        'permission_callback' => '__return_true'
    ]);
});
```

### Frontend Integration
Example Next.js API call:

```javascript
const response = await fetch('${wordpressUrl}/wp-json/hybrid-headless/v1/products', {
    headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    }
});
```

## Development

### Local Development Setup
1. Set up a local WordPress installation
2. Clone the plugin repository
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   composer install
   ```
4. Run the development build:
   ```bash
   composer run build-dev
   ```

### Running Tests
```bash
composer run test
```

### Debugging
Enable debug mode in wp-config.php:
```php
define('HYBRID_HEADLESS_DEBUG', true);
```

Debug logs are stored in `wp-content/debug.log`

## Common Issues & Solutions

### CORS Issues
1. Verify your frontend URL is correctly set in the plugin settings
2. Check for any security plugins blocking API requests
3. Ensure proper headers are being sent from your frontend

### 404 Errors
1. Flush WordPress permalinks
2. Verify route patterns in plugin settings
3. Check .htaccess configuration

### Performance Issues
1. Enable object caching
2. Optimize database queries
3. Configure CDN for static assets
