# Hybrid WordPress + Next.js E-commerce Platform

## Project Structure

This repository contains both the frontend Next.js application and the WordPress plugin required for headless e-commerce functionality.

```
/hybrid-headless-front-end/     # Next.js TypeScript application
/hybrid-headless-react-plugin/  # WordPress plugin for headless integration
```

## Architecture Overview

This is a hybrid architecture combining WordPress/WooCommerce with Next.js to create a high-performance e-commerce platform. The system uses WordPress headlessly for specific routes while maintaining traditional WordPress functionality for authenticated user flows.

## Routing Architecture

### Overview
The application uses a sophisticated hybrid routing system that combines static routes with dynamic routing capabilities, all while maintaining a static export. Here's how it works:

### Route Structure

#### Static Routes
Pre-defined routes with dedicated page components:
```
/                   -> app/page.tsx
/trips             -> app/trips/page.tsx
/trips/[slug]      -> app/trips/[slug]/page.tsx
/categories        -> app/categories/page.tsx
/categories/[slug] -> app/categories/[slug]/page.tsx
```

#### Dynamic Parameters
Routes that use URL parameters:
- `[slug]` captures a single URL segment
- Example: `/trips/mountain-adventure` → `slug = "mountain-adventure"`

#### Catch-all Route
A fallback route that handles any undefined paths:
- Located at `app/[...slug]/page.tsx`
- Captures all segments of the URL
- Example: `/any/unknown/path` → `slug = ["any", "unknown", "path"]`

### Route Priority
Routes are matched in order of specificity:
1. Exact static routes (`/trips`, `/categories`)
2. Dynamic parameter routes (`/trips/[slug]`, `/categories/[slug]`)
3. Catch-all route (`[...slug]`)

This is configured in `next.config.js`:
```javascript
async rewrites() {
  return [
    { source: '/trips', destination: '/trips' },
    { source: '/trips/:slug', destination: '/trips/:slug' },
    { source: '/categories', destination: '/categories' },
    { source: '/categories/:slug', destination: '/categories/:slug' },
    { source: '/:path*', destination: '/:path*' }
  ];
}
```

### Static Export

#### Configuration
The app is configured for static export in `next.config.js`:
```javascript
const nextConfig = {
  output: "export",
  images: {
    unoptimized: true,
  },
  trailingSlash: true,
};
```

#### Build Process
1. Run `npm run build` to generate static files
2. Output is created in the `out` directory
3. Files are copied to the WordPress plugin's `dist` directory
4. Plugin serves these static files for frontend routes

#### Deployment
The `deploy.sh` script handles the deployment process:
1. Builds the Next.js application
2. Copies build files to plugin directory
3. Syncs with WordPress server
4. Manages plugin activation/deactivation

### How It Works Together

1. **Initial Request**
   - User visits a URL (e.g., `/trips/mountain-adventure`)
   - WordPress plugin checks if it's a frontend route
   - If yes, serves the static Next.js app

2. **Client-Side Navigation**
   - Next.js router checks for matching static routes
   - If found, renders the corresponding page component
   - If not found, falls back to catch-all route

3. **Data Fetching**
   - Pages fetch data from WordPress REST API
   - API calls are made client-side using `apiService`
   - Loading and error states are handled by components

4. **Static Assets**
   - Images, scripts, and styles are served from `/dist/_next/`
   - WordPress plugin handles static file serving
   - Cache headers are set for optimal performance

### Development Workflow

1. **Local Development**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   - Runs Next.js development server
   - Hot reloading enabled
   - API calls to WordPress backend

2. **Building for Production**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
   - Generates static export
   - Creates optimized production build
   - Prepares files for WordPress plugin

3. **Deployment**
   ```bash
   npm run deploy
   ```
   - Runs build process
   - Syncs files with WordPress server
   - Manages plugin state

### Important Considerations

1. **SEO and Performance**
   - Static export provides excellent performance
   - Initial HTML is pre-rendered
   - Client-side navigation is smooth and fast

2. **API Integration**
   - All data fetching happens client-side
   - API responses should be fast for optimal UX
   - Consider implementing caching strategies

3. **Error Handling**
   - 404 pages for unknown routes
   - Loading states during data fetching
   - Error boundaries for component failures

4. **Browser Support**
   - Works in modern browsers
   - Requires JavaScript enabled
   - Consider polyfills if needed

## Frontend Features
