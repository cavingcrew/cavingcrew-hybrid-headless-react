# Hybrid WordPress + Next.js E-commerce Platform

## Architecture Overview

This is a hybrid architecture combining WordPress/WooCommerce with Next.js to create a high-performance e-commerce platform. The system uses WordPress headlessly for specific routes while maintaining traditional WordPress functionality for authenticated user flows.

### Deployment Architecture

#### Next.js Frontend
- Runs as a Node.js application managed by PM2
- Server-side rendering for dynamic content
- Proxied through Nginx for production traffic
- Environment variables managed through PM2 ecosystem config

#### WordPress Backend
- Traditional WordPress installation
- WooCommerce for e-commerce functionality
- Custom REST API endpoints for Next.js integration
- Handles authenticated routes directly

## Routing Architecture

### Overview
The application uses a sophisticated hybrid routing system that combines static routes with dynamic routing capabilities, all while maintaining a static export. Here's how it works:

### Route Structure

#### Static Routes
Pre-defined routes with dedicated page components:
```
/                   -> app/page.tsx
/trips             -> app/trips/page.tsx
/trips/[slug]      -> app/trips/[slug]/page.tsx
/categories        -> app/categories/page.tsx
/categories/[slug] -> app/categories/[slug]/page.tsx
```

#### Dynamic Parameters
Routes that use URL parameters:
- `[slug]` captures a single URL segment
- Example: `/trips/mountain-adventure` → `slug = "mountain-adventure"`

#### Catch-all Route
A fallback route that handles any undefined paths:
- Located at `app/[...slug]/page.tsx`
- Captures all segments of the URL
- Example: `/any/unknown/path` → `slug = ["any", "unknown", "path"]`

### Route Priority
Routes are matched in order of specificity:
1. Exact static routes (`/trips`, `/categories`)
2. Dynamic parameter routes (`/trips/[slug]`, `/categories/[slug]`)
3. Catch-all route (`[...slug]`)

This is configured in `next.config.js`:
```javascript
async rewrites() {
  return [
    { source: '/trips', destination: '/trips' },
    { source: '/trips/:slug', destination: '/trips/:slug' },
    { source: '/categories', destination: '/categories' },
    { source: '/categories/:slug', destination: '/categories/:slug' },
    { source: '/:path*', destination: '/:path*' }
  ];
}
```

### Routing Flow Examples

#### Frontend (Next.js) Routes

1. **Product Page Example** (`/trips/mountain-adventure`)
```
User requests /trips/mountain-adventure
↓
WordPress receives request
↓
Hybrid_Headless_Routes_Controller checks if it's a frontend route
↓
Matches '^trips/[^/]+/?' pattern, confirms it's a frontend route
↓
Serves static Next.js app (index.html)
↓
Next.js app boots up in browser
↓
Next.js client-side routing matches /trips/[slug]
↓
TripPage component renders
↓
Component fetches trip data from WordPress API
```

2. **Category Listing Example** (`/categories`)
```
User requests /categories
↓
WordPress receives request
↓
Hybrid_Headless_Routes_Controller checks if it's a frontend route
↓
Matches '^categories/?' pattern, confirms it's a frontend route
↓
Serves static Next.js app (index.html)
↓
Next.js app boots up in browser
↓
Next.js client-side routing matches /categories
↓
CategoriesPage component renders
↓
Component fetches categories data from WordPress API
```

#### WordPress Routes

1. **Checkout Example** (`/checkout`)
```
User requests /checkout
↓
WordPress receives request
↓
Hybrid_Headless_Routes_Controller checks if it's a frontend route
↓
No match found in frontend patterns
↓
WordPress handles request normally
↓
WooCommerce checkout page renders
↓
Traditional WordPress/WooCommerce functionality takes over
```

2. **My Account Example** (`/my-account`)
```
User requests /my-account
↓
WordPress receives request
↓
Hybrid_Headless_Routes_Controller checks if it's a frontend route
↓
No match found in frontend patterns
↓
WordPress handles request normally
↓
WooCommerce account page renders
↓
User authentication and account management handled by WordPress
```

3. **Admin Example** (`/wp-admin`)
```
User requests /wp-admin
↓
WordPress receives request
↓
Hybrid_Headless_Routes_Controller checks if it's a frontend route
↓
No match found in frontend patterns
↓
WordPress handles request normally
↓
WordPress login/admin interface renders
↓
Traditional WordPress admin functionality available
```

#### Client-Side Navigation

When navigating between frontend routes after initial load:
```
User clicks link to /trips/new-adventure
↓
Next.js intercepts click event
↓
Client-side routing handles navigation
↓
URL updates without full page reload
↓
New component renders
↓
Component fetches new data from WordPress API
↓
UI updates smoothly
```

This hybrid approach provides:
- Fast, app-like experience for content browsing
- Traditional WordPress functionality where needed
- Seamless transitions between modes
- Proper handling of authenticated routes

### Server Configuration

#### PM2 Configuration
The application uses PM2 for process management:
```javascript
// ecosystem.config.js
{
  apps: [{
    name: 'hybrid-headless-frontend',
    script: 'node_modules/next/dist/bin/next',
    args: 'start',
    env: {
      PORT: 3000,
      NODE_ENV: 'production',
      NEXT_PUBLIC_WORDPRESS_API_URL: 'https://www.cavingcrew.com/wp-json'
    }
  }]
}
```

#### Nginx Configuration
Nginx proxies requests to the Next.js application:
```nginx
location / {
    proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
    proxy_http_version 1.1;
    proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
    proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
}
```

### How It Works Together

1. **Initial Request**
   - User visits a URL (e.g., `/trips/mountain-adventure`)
   - WordPress plugin checks if it's a frontend route
   - If yes, serves the static Next.js app

2. **Client-Side Navigation**
   - Next.js router checks for matching static routes
   - If found, renders the corresponding page component
   - If not found, falls back to catch-all route

3. **Data Fetching**
   - Pages fetch data from WordPress REST API
   - API calls are made client-side using `apiService`
   - Loading and error states are handled by components

4. **Static Assets**
   - Images, scripts, and styles are served from `/dist/_next/`
   - WordPress plugin handles static file serving
   - Cache headers are set for optimal performance

### Development Workflow

1. **Local Development**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   - Runs Next.js development server
   - Hot reloading enabled
   - API calls to WordPress backend

2. **Production Build**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
   - Creates optimized server-side rendering build
   - Prepares for PM2 deployment

3. **Deployment**
   ```bash
   npm run deploy
   ```
   - Runs build process
   - Syncs with production server
   - Updates PM2 process

### Environment Variables

Create `.env.local` for development:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_WORDPRESS_API_URL=https://www.cavingcrew.com/wp-json
```

Production variables are managed through PM2 ecosystem config.

### Performance Considerations

1. **Server-Side Rendering**
   - Initial page load includes complete HTML
   - Improved SEO performance
   - Better Core Web Vitals

2. **Caching Strategy**
   - Server-side caching of API responses
   - Client-side caching for static assets
   - Stale-while-revalidate for dynamic content

3. **API Optimization**
   - Efficient data fetching
   - Minimized API calls
   - Response caching

### Monitoring

The application can be monitored using:
```bash
pm2 monit
pm2 logs hybrid-headless-frontend
pm2 status
```

### Troubleshooting

1. **Process Issues**
   ```bash
   pm2 logs
   pm2 restart hybrid-headless-frontend
   ```

2. **Build Issues**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

3. **Deployment Issues**
   ```bash
   pm2 delete hybrid-headless-frontend
   pm2 start ecosystem.config.js
   ```

### Important Considerations

1. **SEO and Performance**
   - Static export provides excellent performance
   - Initial HTML is pre-rendered
   - Client-side navigation is smooth and fast

2. **API Integration**
   - All data fetching happens client-side
   - API responses should be fast for optimal UX
   - Consider implementing caching strategies

3. **Error Handling**
   - 404 pages for unknown routes
   - Loading states during data fetching
   - Error boundaries for component failures

4. **Browser Support**
   - Works in modern browsers
   - Requires JavaScript enabled
   - Consider polyfills if needed
